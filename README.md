- Algorithm
- Data Structure
    --  Linked List
    --  Stack

Data Structure: The way of storing data. Each structure has a particular order in which the operations are performed.
Linked List: Liner data structure.  It's often used because of its efficient insertion and deletion.
Stack: Liner data structure. The order is LIFO(Last In First Out).
